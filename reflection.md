# Project Reflection
Which AI tool(s) did you use?
For this project, I used Claude as my primary AI tool for generating code sections. Claude helped me create both HTML and CSS components for my landing page.
How did it help you?
Claude was extremely helpful in several ways:
1.	Code Generation: The AI quickly generated well-structured HTML sections and CSS styling that saved me significant development time. In particular, the hero section and services section of both HTML and CSS were primarily AI-generated, which I've noted in comments within the code.
2.	Design Suggestions:  Claude gave some modern design solutions like card layouts, animations and responsive behavior that really helped to give the page a nice look and feel.
3.	Problems of efficiency: I was able to spend more time copying whatever I could find on the web, and then customizing and refining it for my own needs. It enabled me to finish the project more quickly and with great quality.
4.	Learning: By looking into the code that was generated with AI, I learned new ways of accomplishing certain tasks and implemented some of the best practices I’ve seen previously in the past.
What challenges did you encounter?
Although using AI for coding assist will have the benefits, I ran into some challenges.
1.	AI Generated Code: The AI generated code was used as a basis, then I had to add many customized aspects to ‘make’ them fit my own personal brand and style preference.
2.	Issues with Generated Code: AI Sometimes generated complex CSS or Javascript that I had to take the time to read and understand before making changes or using.
3.	Additional Adjustments and Testing: Additional adjustments were necessary to ensure that the AI generated sections would work well at all sizes of devices.
4.	Issues that arose: Occasionally I combined AI generated code with my present code and then styling and functionality were not working together, needing clarification.
What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?”
Finally, I learned some helpful lessons regarding using AI coding, and this project has been a great opportunity to practice and learn about them.
1. Complementary, not a Successor: AI is most effective as a complementary tool rather than a substitute for human coding abilities. It is great at generating boiler plate code and suggesting implementations but still requires human oversight.
2. Time Efficiency: With the power of AI it saved me so much development time that I could move on with more creative as well as user experience oriented development instead of spending time writing again and again.
3. Use Case: AI generated code can be leveraged as a learning resource to learn about new techniques and methods which expand a developer's skill set with.
4. The Right Balance: It’s all about getting the balance right between AI help and manual coding. Some had better manual development and others took great input from AI.
5. Academic honesty: Document which parts of the code were AI assisted both for credits and in maintaining future work.
Overall, this project has taught me that web development with AI tools is very helpful when they are used wisely. Without improving the quality or the personal touch of the final product, they can help to improve productivity. Considering the evolution of AI tools in the future, I expect these kind of tools would start to play an increasingly important role in my development process.
